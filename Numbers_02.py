 # the case of INTEGERS is one of most simplest in python-

# adding integers

# multiplying integers-
multiply = 55*5

# in python exponent is represented by '**' instead of '^'

# assigning multiple values or numbers to variable-

# now lets chexk if same works for strings- i do not think it will work-


# yeah i was right- i did not work-you can ry yourself in the above empty space-

# use all capital letters while naming variable to treat it as constant-
